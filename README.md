Goal is to make a Retrieval-Augmented GeneratorÂ (RAG) for any github repo, currently the project uses a Small Language Model i.e. tinyllama to generate text based on the content of the README.md file.

## TODO:
- [ ] Add directories and files recursively for the whole github repo.
- [ ] Experiment with different models maybe RLHF models would perform better.
- [ ] Automate the process using github action or make a pipeline which creates a RAG just by giving the repo link.
- [ ] Make a interface using streamlit.
- [ ] Manage ollama dependencies.
